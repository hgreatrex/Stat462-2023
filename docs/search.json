    "text": "R is a free, open source statistical programming language. It contains millions of commands that are useful for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.\nBy a “programming language”, I mean it is a collection of commands that you can type into the computer in order to analyse and visualise data.\nThe easiest way I find to think about R is that it is literally a language, like Spanish or Hindi, that is spoken by your computer. Learning R means learning vocabulary and grammar in order to communicate. It also means it will get easier with experience and practice..\n\n\n\n\nR-studio is a software environment, e.g a programmed designed to make it easy to write code in “R”.\nIt has many useful features. For example, you can easily see help files, run code, see your output and create outputs like this lab book! R-Studio also allows us to make interactive documents called R-Markdown files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-studio is much more sophisticated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch this 1 minute video on R-Studio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\nOr, if you prefer, this 5 minute video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn R-project is a folder that will store everything to do with each lab in one place on your computer. On the website, each lab will be its own project.\nThis is incredibly useful - it means that if you switch from R-Cloud, to the lab computers, to your laptop, all you have to do is to move the folder and everything will just work. Equally, its easy to compare labs.\nLearn more here. You will have a project for each Lab and I may share projects with example code.\n\n\n\nRproject\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to do the labs, on your own computer or on the R studio Cloud website.\n\nDESKTOP: Means do this if you are using your own computer or laptop\nCLOUD: Means do this if you are using the website\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to get R-studio is to simply to use the R-Studio Cloud website\nHere you can log into an online version of R. and I believe is free for the first 25hrs each month. Like Jupyter Notebook, you can also programme in other langauges. If you need more time, you can make a new account, or pay for one month, or move to your desktop.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nSuper Easy. You will never have to worry about versions or updating.\nProjects are incredibly easy and I can debug things fast\nYou can do your labs anywhere you have access to a webpage \n\nDisadvantages:\n\nIt’s not as powerful, you won’t be able to play will millions of data points\nYou have to be online; bad internet connections make it harder\n\n\nTo sign up, make an account at https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free, then click the tabs here to look around. Sadly there is no student pricing right now.\n\n\n\nOnce you have logged in, you will get to a dashboard like this, called the R-studio workspace. You make a new project by clicking the button on the top right. You can open different projects in different tabs on your browser. You can also go back to the work-space at any time.\nYou can get here from any web-browser, You do not need a special computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cloud dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the cloud this is very easy, just go back to https://rstudio.cloud/content/yours\n \n\n\n\nIgnore this until later on and you need to submit your lab.\nYou will need to submit two files for each lab, an “.Rmd” and a “.html”. More later on those, but here is how to download them so you can submit them\n\nOn the R-Studio Cloud website; inside your project, go to the files tab (next to Projects/Help in one quadrant. You will see a list of files, one with the file type .Rmd (your code) and one with .html(the website you made when you pressed knit). Look at the red circle in the pic below\nClick the checkbox to the left the .RmD\nLook just above at the Files quadrant settings menu. Click the blue “more” cogwheel icon. (see diagram)\nNow click export. This will download the file and export it to Canvas s\nREPEAT FOR THE HTML (you can do them together but it exports as a zip)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply click the upload button inside your project in the files tab and upload your files. You do not need subfolders.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook near the red circles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like English has evolved over the years, the R language is always evolving. We keep track using Versions.\nTo make sure we are all on the same page, you need the most up-to-date version of the R commands.\nThe version of R I am using is :\n\n\n[1] \"R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) Innocent and Trusting\"\n\n\nAs long as yours is that or above that you should be fine. The current most recent version of the language on the website is:\n\n\n[1] \"The latest release (2022-10-31, Innocent and Trusting)\""

    "text": "You will be creating two files; an Rmd file containing your code and a .html file for viewing your finished document.\nYou need to submit both of these files on the relevant Canvas assignment page. Remember you can also add comments to your submission as/if needed.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 70 points available. Remember you can drop your lowest lab (e.g. you can skip one)\nYou can see the SPECIFIC RUBRIC we use for this lab on the canvas page. It’s literally how we will award the marks.\nWe will also provide as much feedback as possible, so please remember to click the rubric button to take a look.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, here is what your lab should correspond to:\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    POINTS \n    Approx grade \n    What it means \n  \n \n\n  \n    68-70 \n    A* \n    Exceptional.  Above and beyond.   THIS IS HARD TO GET. \n  \n  \n    65-68 \n    A \n    Everything asked for with high quality.   Class example \n  \n  \n    60-65 \n    B+/A- \n    Solid work but the odd  mistake or missing answer in either the code or interpretation \n  \n  \n    55-60 \n    B-/B \n    Starting to miss entire/questions sections, or multiple larger mistakes. Still a solid attempt.  \n  \n  \n    49-55 \n    C/C+ \n    It’s clear you tried and learned something.  Just attending labs will get you this much as we can help you get to this stage \n  \n  \n    40-49 \n    D \n    You submit a single word AND have reached out to Dr G or Aish for help before the deadline (make sure to comment you did this so we can check) \n  \n  \n    30-40 \n    F \n    You submit a single word…....  ANYTHING..                Think, that's 30-40 marks towards your total…. \n  \n  \n    0+ \n    F \n    Didn’t submit, or incredibly limited attempt.  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have technical problems & have sent me canvas message with our code and a screenshot of the issue BEFORE THE DEADLINE, all late penalties go away until we have fixed it.\nSubmitting late is a risk. The lab might be graded at any time past the deadline with no notice given. If worked answers are released then that is too late.\nBut.. I would prefer you submit late than not at all. If you’re going to be late for any reason (you don’t need to explain why), send Dr G a canvas message.\nI will only start penalizing if you’re consistently late and I have sent a written warning. See the course syllabus for more info. https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243429/assignments/syllabus\n\n\n\n\nYou can talk with each other to help during these labs e.g. you can see each others screens and work out answers together. I will try as much as possible to provide alternate datasets.\nBUT NEVER SHARE CODE/SEND SCRIPTS.\nALL TEXT SHOULD BE IN YOUR OWN WORDS.\nFor example:\n\nWorking out together the right way to apply the seq() function, then each independently adding it to your own scripts is OK.\nCopy/pasting your friend’s code/text is not..\nSo DISCUSS with friends, but then turn away to your own screen and write your own code and text.\n\nI will be randomly running lab reports through plagiarism software."
