To see previous commands, you can click the history tab (Environment quadrant) or press the up/down arrows on your keyboard, but when you close R, all record of these commands will be lost. We need instead is a way to save the commands for future use - we can do this using scripts.\nThere are several types of document, or script that you can create and save in R-Studio. There are about 20 options in the file menu.\nIn this course we are going to focus on the R-Markdown format and you are going to submit your labs as websites/html files along with your code.\nImagine a normal Microsoft Word document, but halfway through you can press a button and a mini R console appears. You type your code inside the mini console, it runs and puts the plots/output just below - then you leave the console and continue writing about the results. Essentially you never have to take another screenshot of results and move it to your output… Rmd files are also flexible. You can turn them into reports, websites, blogs, presentations or applications with a few short commands.\nRead more here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com or watch this short video"

    "text": "What are packages?\nAs described earlier, we program in R by typing a series of commands. R is open source and anyone can create a new command. Just as people keep creating apps for phones, over the last 20 years,tens of millions of new custom commands have been created.\nCommands tend to be grouped together into collections called Packages or Libraries (two names for the same thing). For example, one package contains the complete works of Shakespeare; another allows interactive website design; another allows advanced Bayesian statistics. There is a package for literally everything and there are now over 20,000 packages available. You can see a selection here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html\nJust as you don’t have every app in the world on your phone, this is far too much to store on your computer, so we choose the ones we need from a free online “app/package store”. You can download the ones you want, ready to load later.\nSo to access the commands in a package we need these two steps:\n\nONCE ONLY: Download the package from the internet, in the way you download an app from the app store\nEVERY TIME: Load the packages you want, like clicking an app icon to open it.\n\nA close analogy is your phone: There are millions of apps available from banking, to 50 different calendar apps. You don’t have every app in the world installed on your phone - and you don’t have every app you do download running at the same time.  Instead you download the apps that you think you will need (occasionally downloading a new one on the fly) - and when you need to use an app, you click on it to open."

NOTE! For R studio cloud online, you might have to do this for each project.\n\nLook for the quadrant with the packages tab in it.\n\nYou will see a list of packages/apps that have already been installed.\nClick the INSTALL button in the Packages tab menu (on the left)\nStart typing the package name and it will show up (check the include dependencies box).

It means it loaded the package without errors. Otherwise, I suggest running this command TWICE! This is because loading packages will print “friendly messages” or “welcome text” the first time you load them.\nFor example, this is what shows up when you install the tidyverse package. The welcome text is indicating the sub-packages that tidyverse downloaded and also that some commands now have a different meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nTidyverse install messages\n\n\n\n\nTo find out if what you are seeing is a friendly message or an error, run the command again.

    "text": "Making tables\nSometimes we want to see how many rows there are in different categories. The easiest way to do this is using the table command. For example, in our New York data, we can see how many houses there are with each number of beds using\n\ntable(HousesNY$Beds)\n\n\n 2  3  4  5  6 \n 5 26 19  2  1 \n\n\nSo there are 19 rows in our dataset where the Beds column says 4 (AKA 19 houses in our sample with 4 beds). Or we can look at a 2 dimensional table\n\ntable(HousesNY$Beds, HousesNY$Baths)\n\n   \n     1 1.5  2 2.5  3 3.5\n  2  2   0  3   0  0   0\n  3  8   3 14   0  1   0\n  4  3   1 10   1  3   1\n  5  0   0  1   0  0   1\n  6  0   0  1   0  0   0\n\n\nSo there are 10 houses with 4 beds and 2 baths\nTo make these look more professional there are a number of packages you can install and use.

Sometimes we want to deal with only one specific column in our spreadsheet/dataframe, for example applying the mean/standard deviation/inter-quartile range command to say just the Price column.\nTo do this, we use the $ symbol. For example, here I’m simply selecting the data in the elevation column only and saving it to a new variable called elevationdata.\n\ndata(\"HousesNY\")\nprice <- HousesNY$Price\n\nprice\n\nTry it yourself. You should have seen that as you typed the $, it gave you all the available column names to choose from.\nThis means we can now easily summarise specific columns. For example:\n\nsummary(HousesNY) will create a summary of the whole spreadsheet,\nsummary(HousesNY$Price) will only summarise the Price column.\n\nmean(HousesNY$Price) will take the mean of the Price column in the HousesNY dataframe."

    "text": "which command\nThe which command essentially says “which numbers” meet a certain threshold\ne,g,\n\na <- 100:110\nwhich(a > 107)\n\n[1]  9 10 11\n\n\nOr which rows:\n\noutlier_rows <- which(frost$Dist_to_Coast < 1.5)\n\n\nDeleting rows\nOr if you know the row number you can use the minus - sign to remove. Or just filter below.\n\n# remove row 6 and and overwrite\nfrost <- frost[-6 ,]\n\n# remove columns 4 and 2 and save result to newdata and overwrite\nnewdata <- frost[, - c(2,4) ]\n\n\n\nThe dplyr filter command (tidyverse)\nFiltering means selecting rows/observations based on their values. To filter in R, use the command filter() from the dplyr package. I tend to write it as dplyr:filter() to force it to be correct.\nHere we can apply the filter command to choose specific rows that meet certain criteria\n\nfilter(frost, State == \"FL\")\n\nThe double equal operator == means equal to. The command is telling R to keep the rows in frost where the State column equals “FL”.\nIf you want a few categories, choose the %in% operator, using the c() command to stick together the categories you want. For example, here are states in Florida and Virginia.\n\nfilter(frost, State %in% c(\"FL\",\"VA\"))\n\nWe can also explicitly exclude cases and keep everything else by using the not equal operator !=. The following code excludes airport stations.\n\nfilter(frost, Type_Fake != \"Airport\")\n\nWhat about filtering if a row has a value greater than a specified value? For example, Stations with an elevation greater than 500 feet?\n\nfilter(frost, Elevation > 500)\n\nOr less-than-or-equal-to 200 feet.\n\n# or save the result to a new variable\nlowland_stations <- filter(frost, Elevation < 200)\nsummary(lowland_stations)\n\n\nIn addition to comparison operators, filtering may also utilize logical operators that make multiple selections. There are three basic logical operators: & (and), | (or), and ! (not). We can keep Stations with an Elevation greater than 300 and State in Alabama &.\n\nfilter(frost, Elevation > 300 & State == \"AL\")\n\nUse | to keep Stations with a Type_Fake of “Airport” or a last spring frost date after April (~ day 90 of the year).\n\nfilter(frost, Type_Fake == \"Airport\" | Avg_DOY_SpringFrost > 90 )\n\n\n\nThe dplyr arrange command (tidyverse)\n\n\nWe use the arrange() function to sort a data frame by one or more variables. You might want to do this to get a sense of which cases have the highest or lowest values in your data set or sort counties by their name. For example, let’s sort in ascending order by elevation.\n\narrange(frost, Latitude)\n\n# A tibble: 75 × 8\n   Station     State Type_Fake           Avg_D…¹ Latit…² Longi…³ Eleva…⁴ Dist_…⁵\n   <chr>       <chr> <chr>                 <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 Inverness   FL    City                   50.6    28.8   -82.3      40   20.5 \n 2 Ocala       FL    City                   52.7    29.2   -82.1      75   41.6 \n 3 Lake        FL    City                   60.6    30.2   -82.6     195   63.0 \n 4 Tallahassee FL    Agricultural_Resea…    75.8    30.4   -84.4      55   23.2 \n 5 Fernandina  FL    City                   46.9    30.7   -81.5      13    1.15\n 6 De          FL    City                   71.3    30.7   -86.1     245   29.4 \n 7 Quitman     GA    City                   65.5    30.8   -83.6     185   56.4 \n 8 Brunswick   GA    Agricultural_Resea…    48.4    31.2   -81.5      13    7.18\n 9 Waycross    GA    Agricultural_Resea…    75.9    31.2   -82.3     145   52.4 \n10 Tifton      GA    City                   87.3    31.4   -83.5     380  101.  \n# … with 65 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Avg_DOY_SpringFrost,\n#   ²​Latitude, ³​Longitude, ⁴​Elevation, ⁵​Dist_to_Coast\n\n\nBy default, arrange() sorts in ascending order. We can sort by a variable in descending order by using the desc() function on the variable we want to sort by. For example, to sort the dataframe by Avg_DOY_SpringFrost in descending order we use\n\narrange(frost, desc(Avg_DOY_SpringFrost))\n\n# A tibble: 75 × 8\n   Station        State Type_Fake        Avg_D…¹ Latit…² Longi…³ Eleva…⁴ Dist_…⁵\n   <chr>          <chr> <chr>              <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1 Marshall       NC    Airport             118.    35.8   -82.7    2000   258. \n 2 Highlands      NC    Agricultural_Re…    118.    35.0   -83.2    3333   235. \n 3 Mt             NC    City                113.    36.5   -80.6    1041   216. \n 4 Louisburg      NC    City                113.    36.1   -78.3     260    88.5\n 5 Rocky          VA    Airport             111.    37.0   -79.9    1315   180. \n 6 Henderson      NC    Agricultural_Re…    111.    36.3   -78.4     512    97.9\n 7 Farmville      VA    Airport             111.    37.3   -78.4     450    97.1\n 8 Statesville    NC    City                110.    35.8   -80.9     951   185. \n 9 Valley         AL    City                110.    34.6   -85.6    1020   295. \n10 Hendersonville NC    Agricultural_Re…    110.    35.3   -82.4    2160   227. \n# … with 65 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Avg_DOY_SpringFrost,\n#   ²​Latitude, ³​Longitude, ⁴​Elevation, ⁵​Dist_to_Coast"

    "section": "Boxplots",
    "text": "Boxplots\nBoxplots have been around over 40 years! See their history and evolution here: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/boxplots.pdf\nIn terms of your reports, you need to think of 3 things: - Why you are making the plot (quick look vs publication worthy final graphic) - What aspects of the data do you want to highlight (lots of data, comparing groups, weird distributions..) - What are your final requirements and personal style (colorblind friendly, you’re drawn to a certain type of plot..)\nSo for boxplots.. they are especially good at allowing you to compare different groups of things or to look for multiple groups in a single response variable. Here is a beautiful example made by Marcus Beckman on dissertation lengths (description here: https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/average-dissertation-and-thesis-length-take-two/ and code here: https://github.com/fawda123/diss_proc )\nIf there are only one or two variables, I often jump to the violin or histogram plots as they show more detail.\nSo.. how to make these yourselves. You have a range of options!\n\nBasics (single boxplot)\nHere is the most basic boxplot you can make. I often start with this for my own use when exploring the data, then later decide which plots to “make pretty”.\n\nboxplot(HousesNY$Price)\n\n\n\n\nWe can make better boxplots in base R (e.g. using no special packages/libraries). See this tutorial for all the details: https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/box-plot/ which goes through exactly what each line means.\n\n# one big command on separate lines\nboxplot(HousesNY$Price,\n        main = \"House prices of Canton NY sample\",\n        xlab = \"Price (Thousand USD)\",\n        col = \"light blue\",\n        border = \"dark blue\",\n        horizontal = TRUE,\n        notch = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nThere are specific plotting packages, the most famous being ggplot2 (there are data camp courses on it). The absolute basics. Here x is blank because we just want to look at the price column alone.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(HousesNY, aes(x =\"\", y = Price)) +    ## this loads the data\n   geom_boxplot()                            ## and we choose a boxplot\n\n\n\n\nNote for now, think of the %>% symbol and + symbol also as “one command on multiple lines..”. They allow you to build up layers of the plot. Data camp has more on this.\nBut with these we can easily do more sophisticated things.

We will discuss the other values in later labs/lectures.\nNow let’s see how to add the regression line to our scatterplot. We can do this using abline(REGRESSION_VARIABLE), where regression_variable is the name of the variable you saved the output of lm to. For example.\n\nplot(HousesNY$Price ~ HousesNY$Lot)\nabline(lm(Price ~ Lot,data=HousesNY),col=\"blue\",lwd=1) \n\n\n\n\nFor more professional plots, see the scatterplots tutorial"

    "text": "Functions/Commands\nWatch this short video to learn three important facts about functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe power of R lies in its many thousands of these built in commands, or functions. In fact, we have already come across one - the plot command. A function, or command is simply an action you can take - like pressing the square root button on a calculator.\nA command is always followed by parentheses ( ), inside which you put your “arguments” (e.g. the thing you want to take the square root of)\nTry typing these EXACTLY into the console.\n\nnchar(\"hello\")\n\nThis will count the number of letters in the word “hello” (e.g.\n\n\n\n\nfile.choose()\n\nThis will open up an interactive window (sometimes behind the studio screen), choose any file and it will print the location in the console. NOTE WE STILL NEED THE PARENTHESES, but there are no arguments so they are empty.\n\n\nTo understand what I mean about parentheses, try typing each of these commands exactly and see what happens.\n\n# Typing this into the console will print out the underlying code\nfile.choose \n\n# Typing it WITH parentheses will run the command. Note for this command, the parentheses are empty!  \nfile.choose()\n\n# Typing a ? in front will open the help file for that command in the help quadrant\n?file.choose\n\nSometimes we need to give the command some additional information as an argument. Anything we wish to tell the command should be included inside the inside the parentheses (separated by commas). The command literally only knows about the stuff inside the parentheses.\n\nsin(1) # trigonometry functions.  Apply the sine function to the number 1. \n\nlog(10) # natural logarithm.  Take the natural logarithm of the number 10. \n\nnchar(\"hello\") # Count the letters in the word hello\n\nWe can also add optional extra arguments. For example let’s improve our plot. This following command will plot the number 1 to 10 against the numbers 12 to 20, along with some axis labels. When you run this, the plot will show up in the plots tab.\n\n# plot the numbers 1 to 10 against the numbers 11 to 20\nplot(1:10,11:20,col=\"dark blue\", xlab=\"x values\",ylab=\"GEOG-364 is the best\") \n\n\n\n\nIf you are feeling lost, https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/ is a good website which goes over a lot of this in more detail."

    "title": "Tutorial 3: R-Basics",
    "section": "Variables",
    "text": "Variables\nSo now we can use R as a calculator and even add a few more complex commands. What we need to be able to do now is to save the results, or load in data so we can run more complex commands. We do this through assigning our results to a variable. By this I mean we save the results and give them a name, then in the future, instead of retyping the whole command, we simply type that name and R will recall the answer.\nThe symbol to store data into a variable is using the assignment arrow <-, which is made up of the left arrow and a dash. You can also use the equals sign, but it can cause complications later on. Try typing this command into the console:\n\nx <- 1/50\n\nNotice that pressing enter did not print a value onto your screen as it did earlier. Instead, look down at the environment tab, you should notice that an x has turned up, with the result next to it.\nSo our variable x is now associated with the value 0.02, or 1/50. You can print a variable on screen by typing its name, no quotes, or by using the print command. Try printing out your variable.\n\nx\n\n# or\n\nprint(x)\n\n# see what happens when you do this\n\nprint(\"x\")\n\nThis ‘x’ variable can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number. Try typing\n\nlog(x)\n\n# this is now the same as \nlog(1/50)\n\nThe way R works is that first it looks for the commands on the right of the arrow. It runs all of them, calculates the result, then saves that result with the name on the left of the arrow. It does not save the command itself, just the answer. For example, in this case, R has no idea that x was created using maths, it just knows that it is equal to the number 0.02.\nNotice also that variables can be reassigned. Type this into your console.\n\nx <- 100\nprint(x)\n\nx used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.\nNote, the letter x isn’t special in any way, it’s just a variable name. You can replace it with any word you like as long as it contains no spaces and doesn’t begin with a number.\nfor example\n\nvlogbrothers.DFTBA <- \"Dont forget to be awesome\"\nprint(vlogbrothers.DFTBA)\n\nHow you name stuff is up to you, , but be consistent. Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include\n\nperiods.between.words.1 (as you can see, I like this)\nunderscores_between_words\ncamelCaseToSeparateWords\n\nFinally, R IS CASE SENSITIVE. X and x are different variables! Try these and you will see both appear separately in your environment tab.\n\nh <- 1\nH <- 2\n\nans <- h+H\nprint(ans)\n\n\nprint(h)\n\n\nprint(H)\n\nTo delete a variable, you can use the rm() command e.g.\n\nrm(x)\n\nand to clear everything, type\n\nrm(list=ls())\n\n\nCombining variables\nAs I showed above, you can now use multiple variables together in more complex commands. For example, try these commands:\n\nx <- 2\n\n#Take the variable x, add 1 then save it to a new variable called y\ny <- x + 1 \n\n# print the multiple of 2yx onto the screen\nprint(2*y*x)\n\nNow you can see that there are two variables in your environment tab, x and y. Where y is the sum of the contents of x plus 1.\nYou can even use this to change your original variable . Try typing the code below in a few times into the console and see what happens.\nA short cut to do this is to type the commands the first time, then use the up-arrow on your keyboard to cycle back through previous commands you have typed\n\nx <- x + 1 # notice how RStudio updates its description of x in the environment tab\nx          # print the contents of \"x\" onto the screen\n\nOur variables don’t have to be numbers. They could refer to tables of data, or a spatial map, or any other complex thing. We will cover this more in future labs."

This took me quickly to the R documentation page\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook for Rdocumentation, search-R-Project, or Rdrr\n\n\n\n\n\nI ended up at this website: https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/skimr/html/skim.html. From this I saw that the skim() command is in the skimr package*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skim command is in the skimr package (red circle)\n\n\n\n\n\nI added the skimr package to my library code chunk and re-ran\n\n\n# LIBRARIES\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nlibrary(skimr) \n\n\nIn the console, I FIRST typed > ?skimr to read about the package itself (e.g. ?PACKAGENAME). This doesn’t work if you didn’t run the library code chunk first.\n\n\n\nIn the console, I THEN typed > ?skim to bring up the help file and scrolled to the bottom. This doesn’t work if you didn’t run the library code chunk first. Inside every R help file you will see this structure: https://bcgov.github.io/ds-cop-intro-to-r/seeking-help-in-r.html but for now, I scrolled to the bottom.\n\nI then ran the help file worked examples in the console to understand the command. It looks like skim is a nice summary command I can apply to a table (in their case the iris table).

    "text": "The aim of this lab is to get comfortable in R and in R-Markdown, and to practice identifying some study jargon as we practiced in class. Lab instructions will be here and how-tos will be condensed into the Tutorial\nThe Canvas page for this lab is: https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243429/assignments/14748231\nIf the labs are causing major problems with your computer or your computer hardware is struggling (or you have any other software issue), Talk to Dr Greatrex.\nWe can fix this and there are other options for “online R” that you can use.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, please review the lab Q&A: CLICK HERE. It explains\n\nWhat you need to submit\nHow you are graded and where the rubric is\nThe late policy\nWhat counts as cheating\n\n\n\n\nReview CLICK HERE to see some of the powerful things we can do in R.\nWe will do this in class.\nYour homework:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown document called STAT462-Lab1-PSUID.Rmd. e.g. for me STAT462-Lab1-hlg5155.Rmd. \nDelete any friendly welcome text so you have a blank space.\n\n\n\nYou might find it easier to use the markdown visual text editor.  Click the “Visual” symbol at the top left of the document to switch.\n\nIn the white text area, create a level 1 Header called “Introduction to STAT-462”.\nLeave a blank line, then use the STAT-462 syllabus to describe the course late policy in your own words (e.g. you’re writing about this in the white space).\nPress “knit” at the top of the screen. If you haven’t made a mistake a pop up should appear with a html file and your edits. If you have a made a mistake, stop and fix before continuing or talk to a teacher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br<\nLeave another blank line and add a new Level 1 Header called “Code Showcase”. Add a blank line afterwards too - the reason for all the blank lines is that R formatting often gets messed up with not enough blank lines, but it will ignore excess ones.\nCreate a code chunk. Inside use R code to calculate the following. You HAVE to show the code! \n\n1033 (e.g 103*103*103, or 103^3) \n\n_ The co-sine of your age (google is your friend, google R function for cosine) \n\nUse R code to work out how many characters are in the longest town name in Wales Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. \n\n\nHint 1, remember you can copy paste this into your code. \nHint 2.. your tutorials and quote marks!\nHint 3.. you can google any R command, try googling the “R command for number of characters in a word”.\n\n\nPress “knit” at the top of the screen. If you haven’t made a mistake a pop up should appear with a html file and your edits. If you have a made a mistake, stop and fix before continuing.\n\n\n\n\nToday we will be using commands from several packages. Somewhere near the top of your script, make a new code chunk and add this code. We will probably have to install them first (see the tutorial)\nRemember to run the code chunk! (pressing the green arrow, or go to the run button on the top right and press Run All)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a blank line, and create a new level 1 heading called Penguin Analysis. Leave a blank line afterwards too. We’re going to work with a table of data that’s already pre-loaded into R inside the ggplot2 package.\n\nMake sure you have run the library code chunk above without error, or it won’t work. \nLoad the data using this command. You can ignore the raw penguin data\n\n\ndata(\"penguins\")\n\n\n\nType the ?penguins command in the console. This will bring up the help file.\nState the\n\n\nObject of Analysis\nA reasonable population you would be happy to apply this dataset to*\nVariables and units - you are allowed to copy these names/units from the help file\n\n*Imagine you are giving this analysis to a newspaper editor. What population do you think this sample could represent?\n\n\n\n\nNow look at the data itself. If you look in the environment tab, you will see a new variable called penguins Click on it’s NAME to see the spreadsheet/table itself and familiarise yourself with the data.  \nWe could have also looked at the data by either by typing its name into the console, the command View(penguins) or a code chunk, or by using commands like head(penguins) to show the first few lines\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the summary statistics. Leave a blank line and create a new code chunk containing the following code \n\n# mpg comes from the ggplot2 package\n# skim comes from the skimr package\nskim(penguins)\n\nThis command compiles the summary statistics for the penguin dataset - sometimes its easier to view this if you press the knit button and look at the html pop-up. You can also use the summary() command to achieve a similar result \n\nsummary(penguins)\n\nSummarise the dataset.\nThis should include:\n\nA short description of any missing data. For example, are there entire rows missing? Certain columns? Imagine you are using this dataset for modelling, are there rows that will need removing? etc etc? Try `View(penguins)` to look at the penguin dataset itself\n\nHow many penguins were from 2008?\n\nHint, the table command..\nHint 2, to choose a column use the $ sign e.g. tablename$columnname\nHint 3, R IS CASE SENSITIVE!\n\n\nA histogram of one variable of your choice and a description of the variable.\nE.g. unimodal? skewed? Any outliers?\n\n*Hint https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html *\n\n\nA scatterplot between two variables of your choice and a description of the scatterplot\n\nHint https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html *\n*Hint 2, for a description, see this Khan page\n\n\nThe correlation between two variables of your choice\n\nHint, the cor command *\n\n\nA correlation test fully written up in a way that a non expert would understand. For example you include the H0,the H1 the test statistic, the p value and your interpretation. I will let you choose your own significance threshold. You should also show the code output.\n\n*Hint, the cor.test command and see the Canvas correlation page for interpretations.\n\n\n\n*In step 3 and 4 you are allowed to copy the code. There are two reasons for this. The first is that many of you are new to R, it’s lab 1 and I want you to get more exposure to what R looks like (and this is how I learn new coding techniques). The second is that we can spend weeks learning how to make a basic histogram, but now there are all of these amazing professional plots that can be made with a little more code, so I would prefer you spent your time learning them :)\n\n\n\n\nRemember to save your work throughout and to spell check your writing (next to the save button). Now, press the knit button again. If you have not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a html file in your lab 1 folder which includes your answers. If you look at your lab 1 folder, you should see this there - complete with a very recent time-stamp.\nIn that folder, double click on the html file. This will open it in your web-browser.\nCHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.\nIf you are on R studio cloud, see Tutorial 1 for how to download your files\nNow go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in Lab 1."

    "text": "Using R Studio Cloud\nThe easiest way to get R-studio is to use the R-Studio Cloud website\nThis is an online version of R-Studio. and I believe it’s free for the first 25hrs each month. If you need more time, you can make a new account, or pay for one month, or move to your desktop.\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIt’s always up to date\nSuper Easy. You will never have to worry about versions or updating.\nProjects are incredibly easy and I can debug things fast\nYou can do your labs anywhere you have access to a webpage \n\nDisadvantages:\n\nIt’s not as powerful, you won’t be able to play will millions of data points\nYou have to be online; bad internet connections make it harder\n\n\nTo sign up, make an account at https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free, then click the tabs here to look around. Sadly there is no student pricing right now.\n\n\nBefore each lab, making a project\nOnce you have logged in, you will get to a dashboard like this, called the R-studio workspace. You make a new project by clicking the button on the top right. You can open different projects in different tabs on your browser. You can also go back to the work-space at any time.\nYou can get here from any web-browser, You do not need a special computer.\nYOU SHOULD MAKE A NEW PROJECT FOR EACH LAB.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cloud dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning to your lab project\nOn the cloud this is very easy, just go back to https://rstudio.cloud/content/yours\n\n\nDownloading files\nYou will need to submit two files for each lab, an “.Rmd” and a “.html”. More later on those, but here is how to download them from the cloud so you can submit them\n\nOn the R-Studio Cloud website; inside your project, go to the files tab (next to Projects/Help in one quadrant. You will see a list of files, one with the file type .Rmd (your code) and one with .html(the website you made when you pressed knit). Look at the red circle in the pic below\nClick the check-box to the left of the .RmD file\nLook just above at the Files quadrant settings menu. Click the blue “more” cogwheel icon. (see diagram). You might need to make R-Studio full screen to see it.\nNow click export. This will download the file\nREPEAT FOR THE HTML (you can do them together but it exports as a zip)\nSubmit both files on Canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUploading files\nSometimes you want to put your code into R-Studio Cloud, for example if for one week you don’t want to bring your laptop.\nMake a project for the lab, then click the upload button inside your project in the files tab and upload your files. You will only need the .RmD file and any data files. You do not need the html etc (as you create that when you press knit)\n\n\n\n\n\nLook near the red circles"

To do so, pretend you are installing them from scratch. If you are worried this will affect another class, chat with Dr Greatrex before starting out.\nWhy is this so important? Just as English has evolved over the years, the R language is always evolving. We keep track using Versions.\nTo make sure we are all on the same page, you need the most up-to-date version of the R commands.\nThe version of R I am using is :\n\n\n[1] \"R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31) Innocent and Trusting\"\n\n\nAs long as yours is that or above that you should be fine. The current most recent version of the language on the website is:\n\n\n[1] \"The latest release (2022-10-31, Innocent and Trusting)\"\n\n\n\n\nInstalling/updating R.\nTo make R-Studio run on your computer, you need to download TWO things:\n\nR: The thing that teaches your computer the ability to “speak” in R\n\nThe R studio software itself\n\n\nOn a PC:\n\n[STEP 1 of 2] Download & install the R-language itself:\n\nGo to: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ ,\nDownload this version of R (the main download R for windows button)\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"The latest release (2022-10-31, Innocent and Trusting)\"\n\n\n-   Run and click next through all the options\n\n[STEP 2 of 2] Download & install R studio:\n\nGo to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> ,\ndownload R studio for windows\nRun and click next through all the options\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a Mac:\n\n[STEP 1 of 2] Download & install the R-language itself for mac:\n\nGo to:https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ ,\ndownload this version of R (the .pkg file on the left menu)\n\n\n\n[1] \"The latest release (2022-10-31, Innocent and Trusting)\"\n\n\n\nRun and click next through all the options\n\n[STEP 2 of 2] Download & install R studio for mac:\n\nGo to: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download> ,\ndownload R studio for Mac\nRun and click next through all the options\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore each lab, making a project\n\nIMPORTANT! If you haven’t already, on an easy to access place on your computer, make a folder called STAT-462. This is where ALL your labs are going to live.\nNow everything is installed, open R-studio (NOT R!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to the file menu at the very top and click New Project\nSelect New Directory, then New Project\nName your project STAT462-Lab1-PROJECT (or whatever lab it us)\nUnder “create project as a subdirectory of”, hit the browse button and find your STAT-364 folder (you just need to be in the folder, you don’t need to have selected anything). Press open\nFinally, press Create Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to check you are in a project\nR will change slightly. If you look at the top of the screen in the title bar, it should say something like STAT462-Lab1-Project R Studio.\nThe Files tab should have gone to your project folder. Essentially, R-Studio is now “looking” inside your Lab 1 folder, making it easier to find your data and output your results.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to check you are in a project, this one is for my last course\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, R-Studio is now “looking” inside your Lab 1 folder, making it easier to find your data and output your results.\nIf you want one, final check, try typing this into the console (INCLUDING THE EMPTY PARANTHESES/BRACKETS), press enter and see if it prints out the location of Lab 1 on your computer. If not, talk to an instructor.\n\ngetwd()\n\n\n\n\nReturning to your lab project\nOK, let’s imagine that you get halfway through your lab and your computer dies. How do you get back to your Lab work? Try this now. Close down R-Studio.\nTo reopen a lab:\n\nDO NOT RE-OPEN R-STUDIO!\nInstead navigate on your computer to your STAT-462/STAT462-Lab1-Project folder.\nDouble click on the STAT462-Lab1-Project.RProj file.\n\nThis will reopen R for that specific lab, so you can continue where you left off. It means you can also open several versions of R studio for multiple labs, which can be very useful in staying sane"

It is always good to clear these before you start a new analysis. To do this, click the little broom symbol in your environment tab"

To change this, look at the menu at VERY TOP OF THE SCREEN.\n\nIn theView menu, there is a /Panes/Pane Layout menu item, where you can move the on-screen quadrants around. I tend to like the console to be top left and scripts to be top right, with the plots and environment on the bottom - but this is personal choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy preferred set up\n\n\n\n\n\nThere should also be a menu called HelpUseful for R-studio version and Markdown cheatsheets."

    "text": "You will be creating two files; an Rmd file containing your code and a .html file for viewing your finished document.\nYou need to submit both of these files on the relevant Canvas assignment page. Remember you can also add comments to your submission as/if needed.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 70 points available. Remember you can drop your lowest lab (e.g. you can skip one)\nYou can see the SPECIFIC RUBRIC we use for this lab on the canvas page. It’s literally how we will award the marks.\nWe will also provide as much feedback as possible, so please remember to click the rubric button to take a look.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, here is what your lab should correspond to:\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n    POINTS \n    Approx grade \n    What it means \n  \n \n\n  \n    68-70 \n    A* \n    Exceptional.  Above and beyond.   THIS IS HARD TO GET. \n  \n  \n    65-68 \n    A \n    Everything asked for with high quality.   Class example \n  \n  \n    60-65 \n    B+/A- \n    Solid work but the odd  mistake or missing answer in either the code or interpretation \n  \n  \n    55-60 \n    B-/B \n    Starting to miss entire/questions sections, or multiple larger mistakes. Still a solid attempt.  \n  \n  \n    49-55 \n    C/C+ \n    It’s clear you tried and learned something.  Just attending labs will get you this much as we can help you get to this stage \n  \n  \n    40-49 \n    D \n    You submit a single word AND have reached out to Dr G or Aish for help before the deadline (make sure to comment you did this so we can check) \n  \n  \n    30-40 \n    F \n    You submit a single word…....  ANYTHING..                Think, that's 30-40 marks towards your total…. \n  \n  \n    0+ \n    F \n    Didn’t submit, or incredibly limited attempt.  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have technical problems & have sent me canvas message with our code and a screenshot of the issue BEFORE THE DEADLINE, all late penalties go away until we have fixed it.\nSubmitting late is a risk. The lab might be graded at any time past the deadline with no notice given. If worked answers are released then that is too late.\nBut.. I would prefer you submit late than not at all. If you’re going to be late for any reason (you don’t need to explain why), send Dr G a canvas message.\nI will only start penalizing if you’re consistently late and I have sent a written warning. See the course syllabus for more info. https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2243429/assignments/syllabus\n\n\n\n\nYou can talk with each other to help during these labs e.g. you can see each others screens and work out answers together. I will try as much as possible to provide alternate datasets.\nBUT NEVER SHARE CODE/SEND SCRIPTS.\nALL TEXT SHOULD BE IN YOUR OWN WORDS.\nFor example:\n\nWorking out together the right way to apply the seq() function, then each independently adding it to your own scripts is OK.\nCopy/pasting your friend’s code/text is not..\nSo DISCUSS with friends, but then turn away to your own screen and write your own code and text.\n\nI will be randomly running lab reports through plagiarism software."

If it’s on the internet the easiest way is to right click on it and press “save as”, then save the jpeg or png directly into your project folder with an easy filename.\n\nStep 2:\nPlace your picture/photo into your project folder (e.g. your Lab 3 project folder).\n\nStep 3:\nMake a new code chunk. REMEMER TO ADD BLANK LINES ABOVE AND BELOW THE CODE CHUNK.\n\nStep 4\nInside the code chunk, use the knitr::include_graphics() command from the knitr package.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll see I also added some code chunk options:\n\necho=FALSE : don’t show the code\nfig.align - ‘center’ : Centre align the photo when you press knit\nout.width - ‘60%’ : Make your photo smaller or larger on the page\nfig.cap - “your caption” : Add a caption (IN QUOTES). I used * to make mine italic.\n\nIf you run the code chunk by pressing the green arrow, you will see the picture, but not things like the caption.\nNow press knit and you should see the picture, caption and options, but not the code (if echo=FALSE is included)\n\nExample\nFor example, here’s an example on chipmunks. The chipmunk.webp file is inside my project folder. (note, the file type doesn’t matter but you have to type it)\nHere’s how it looks in my .Rmd file.\n\n\n\n\n\nand in the actual report:\n\n\n\n\n\nChipmunks are cool, image from: https://mymodernmet.com/chris-mcveigh-chipmunk-adventures\n\n\n\n\nFor more options see the tutorial: http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/\n\n\nIf you wish to add a video from youtube, you will need to install a new package called vembedr. Follow Tutorial 2 to install this package and add it to your library code chunk and run that code chunk.\nNow make a code chunk and use the embed_url command to embed a video of your choice from youtube/vimeo etc in your report. If you have issues, see teams."

    "text": "Troubleshooting YAML code\n\nNote, if you copy/paste this and it doesn’t work, sometimes the quote marks copy weirdly from the internet - try deleting and retyping the quotes.\n\nIf it still doesn’t work.. this might be because a space is missing (especially if you typed it out).\n\nEditing YAML code can be a pain. It is very case and space sensitive.For example, the spaces at the start of some lines are important and are created using the TAB KEY, not the space bar. There is one TAB key before html_notebook (which is now on a new line). There are two TAB KEYS before toc, toc_float, number_sections and theme.\n\n\nAlso try looking at the theme’s website e.g. google rmdformats add table of contents or similar.\nDon’t continue until you can make and view your html when you press knit. If it doesn’t work, ask for help before moving on"
