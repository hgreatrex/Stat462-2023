# R-Packages {-}


## What are packages? {-}

As described earlier, we program in R by typing a series of commands. Like people keep creating apps for phones, R is open source and anyone can create a new command. Over the last 20 years,tens of millions of new custom commands have been created.

Commands tend to be grouped together into collections called `Packages` or `Libraries` (two names for the same thing). For example, one package contains the complete works of Shakespeare; another allows interactive website design; another allows advanced Bayesian statistics. There is a package for literally everything and there are now about 20,000 packages available. You can see the full list here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html>

This is far too many to store on your computer, so most live on the internet in an online (free) "Package Store". You can download the ones you want, ready to load later.

So to access the commands in a package we need these two steps:

1.  ONCE ONLY: Download the package from the internet, in the way you download an app from the app store
2.  EVERY TIME: Load the packages you want, like clicking an app icon to open it.

**A close analogy is your phone:** There are millions of apps available from banking, to 50 different calendar apps. You don't have every app in the world installed on your phone - and you don't have every app you *do* download running at the same time. <br><br> Instead you download the apps that you think you will need (occasionally downloading a new one on the fly) - and when you need to use an app, you click on it to open.


## Downloading a new package 

This is like going to the app store to get a new app. Just like you only go to the app store once, this is a one-off for each package.  NOTE!  For R studio cloud online, you might have to do this for each project.

-   Look for the quadrant with the packages tab in it.
    -   You will see a list of packages/apps that have already been installed.
    -   Click the INSTALL button in the Packages tab menu (on the left)
    -   Start typing the package name and it will show up (check the include dependencies box). Install the package.

OR

-   R will sometime tell you that you are missing a package (sometimes a little yellow ribbon), click yes to install!

*Note, if you run this command multiple times, or the packages is already loaded, R-Studio might want to restart and sometimes gets confused. If it keeps asking, close R-studio, reopen and try again. If it really doesn't want to work, open the R program itself and run in the console there.*

*Note 2, Sometimes R will ask you if you want to install binaries or other things.  IT WILL ASK THIS IN THE CONSOLE.  It expects you to type yes or no, and to press enter to continue.  Try yes, if it doesn't work (esp xfun), try no.

### TO DO

**Follow the commands above to install the `bardr` package onto your computer**

<br>

## Using the commands inside a package {.unnumbered}

Just like you can't use a phone app until you press the icon, just getting a package from the app-store doesn't make the commands immediately available.

For that you need to load it (like clicking on an app). This can be done with the `library()` command.

In the console type this to install the full works of Shakespeare in the bardr package (<https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/bardr/versions/0.0.9>)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bardr)
```

I suggest keeping all your library() commands in a code chunk near the top of the file and

If you have managed to load a package successfully, often nothing happens - this is great! It means it loaded the package without errors. Otherwise, I suggest running this command TWICE! This is because loading packages will print "friendly messages" or "welcome text" the first time you load them.

For example, this is what shows up when you install the tidyverse package. The welcome text is indicating the sub-packages that tidyverse downloaded and also that some commands now have a different meaning.

```{r, tut3fig4bbb, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Tidyverse install messages",fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut3_basics_fig4.png')
```

**To find out if what you are seeing is a friendly message or an error, run the command again. If you run it a second time and there is no error then nothing should happen.**

<br>

## Use a single command from a package

Sometimes multiple packages name a command the same thing and you want to specify which package you want to use. You can do this using the :: symbol

For example, this command *forces* the computer to use the 'dplyr package' version of filter.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dplyr::filter(mydata)
```

<br>

# R-Basics:

First watch this 5 min video above for some pointers. We will also go through the video more slowly below:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
embed_url("https://youtu.be/SWxoJqTqo08?t=41")
```

<br>

## The Console

The console window (see Figure \@ref(fig:Tut_Fig1)) is essentially a phone call with your computer, where you "speak" in R.

-   The computer has a little `>` symbol to say it is listening/waiting for your command
-   You type in a command
-   The computer tries to carry it out and will print the answer directly onto the screen

Let's start by the simplest command possible. Type this command into your R console and press enter to run.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1+1
```

When you press enter, it should give you the answer.... 2

```{r}
1+1
```

<br>

Type this command into your R console and press enter to run.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Take the sine function of the number 2, like sin(2) on your calculator
sin(2)
```

Here we have a **command** `sin()` applied to the number 2. We also have a **comment** in green, which the computer ignores.

<br>

## Spacing and Capital Letters

-   Spacing *mostly* does not matter: `1+1` will generate the same answer as `1      +       1`.

    -   Exception: you cannot have a space between a command name and its ( ) e.g `sin (2)` will fail\`

-   Capital letters DO matter. R is case sensitive.

-   To see previous commands, you can click the history tab (Environment quadrant) or press the up/down arrows on your keyboard, but when you close R, all record of these commands will be lost.

<br>

<br> \## R as a calculator {#Tut3B_Calc}

When using R as a calculator, the order of operations is the same as you would have learned back in school, so use brackets to force a different order. For example, in either the console or a script, try running these two commands

```{r, eval=FALSE}
3 + 5 * 2
```

and

```{r, eval=FALSE}
(3 + 5) * 2
```

<br>

We can also take shortcuts with our numbers. For example `1:5` means take all the numbers `1 2 3 4 5` (e.g. increment the integers one - to - five). Try typing this command and make sure you understand the result.

```{r}
(1 + 2) * 5:3
```

<br>

We can use this trick to make our first plot! Try entering this command and see what happens. It should plot these numbers against each other

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(data.frame(x=1:5,y=6:10))
```

```{r, eval=FALSE,fig.show=FALSE}
plot(x= 1:5, y= 6:10,xlab="x-axis",ylab="y-axis")
```

<br> <br>

## Asking questions/comparisons

We can also do comparisons in R - using the special symbols TRUE or FALSE (no quote marks, they are special).

Here we are asking R whether 1 is equal to 1.

```{r}
# note two equals signs is read as "is equal to"
1 == 1  
```

We could also have used

-   `!=` "Not equal to"
-   `<` "Less than"
-   `<=` "Less than or equal to\`
-   `>` "Greater than"
-   `>=` "Greater than or equal to"

Now ask the computer if the number 12 is less than or equal to the number 10.

<br> <br>

## The + symbol in the console {#Tut3C_plus}

If you type in an incomplete command, R will understand and wait for you to complete it. For example, if you type `1 +` and press enter, R will know that you are not finished typing. So it will move onto the next line but the `>` will have changed into a `+`, which means its waiting for you to complete your command.

**If you want to cancel a command you can simply hit the "Esc" key or press the little stop symbol and R studio will reset.**

Pressing escape isn't only useful for killing incomplete commands: you can also use it to tell R to stop running code (for example if it's taking much longer than you expect), or to get rid of the code you're currently writing.

<br> <br>

## Functions/Commands {#Tut3D_functions}

Watch this short video to learn three important facts about functions:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
embed_url("http://vimeo.com/220490105 ")

```

The power of R lies in its many thousands of these built in commands, or *functions*. In fact, we have already come across one - the plot command. A function, or command is simply an action you can take - like pressing the square root button on a calculator.

**A command is *always* followed by parentheses ( ), inside which you put your "arguments"** (e.g. the thing you want to take the square root of)

Try typing these EXACTLY into the console.

-   `nchar("hello")`
    -   This will count the number of letters in the word "hello" (e.g.
        5)  
-   `file.choose()`
    -   This will open up an interactive window (sometimes behind the studio screen), choose any file and it will print the location in the console. NOTE WE STILL NEED THE PARENTHESES, but there are no arguments so they are empty.

To understand what I mean about parentheses, try typing each of these commands exactly and see what happens.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Typing this into the console will print out the underlying code
file.choose 

# Typing it WITH parentheses will run the command. Note for this command, the parentheses are empty!  
file.choose()

# Typing a ? in front will open the help file for that command in the help quadrant
?file.choose
```

Sometimes we need to give the command some additional information as an argument. Anything we wish to tell the command should be included inside the inside the parentheses (separated by commas). The command literally only knows about the stuff inside the parentheses.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sin(1) # trigonometry functions.  Apply the sine function to the number 1. 

log(10) # natural logarithm.  Take the natural logarithm of the number 10. 

nchar("hello") # Count the letters in the word hello
```

We can also add optional extra arguments. For example let's improve our plot. This following command will plot the number 1 to 10 against the numbers 12 to 20, along with some axis labels. When you run this, the plot will show up in the plots tab.

```{r}
# plot the numbers 1 to 10 against the numbers 11 to 20
plot(1:10,11:20,col="dark blue", xlab="x values",ylab="GEOG-364 is the best") 
```

If you are feeling lost, <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/> is a good website which goes over a lot of this in more detail.

<br> <br>

## Dealing with text {#Tut3E_text}

In R, the computer interprets most words as commands. But sometimes we need to actually input text, for example for a plot title. **For the computer to understand text, you need quote marks**. The computer will see anything without quote marks as a command.

For example, try typing `print("Hello World")` into the console and the computer should just repeat it back to you.Forget about the quotes and this happens..

```{r, tut3fig3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Your screen after running the project"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut3_basics_fig3.png')
```

Your first error. The "unexpected symbol" it's talking about is the computer thinking that "Hello" and "world" must be two different commands, then getting confused by the space between Hello and World..

<br> <br>

## Variables {#Tut3F_vars}

So now we can use R as a calculator and even add a few more complex commands. What we need to be able to do now is to save the results, or load in data so we can run more complex commands. We do this through assigning our results to a variable. By this I mean we save the results and give them a name, then in the future, instead of retyping the whole command, we simply type that name and R will recall the answer.

The symbol to store data into a variable is using the assignment arrow `<-`, which is made up of the left arrow and a dash. You can also use the equals sign, but it can cause complications later on. Try typing this command into the console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1/50
```

Notice that pressing enter did not print a value onto your screen as it did earlier. Instead, look down at the environment tab, you should notice that an x has turned up, with the result next to it.

So our variable `x` is now associated with the value 0.02, or 1/50. You can print a variable on screen by typing its name, no quotes, or by using the print command. Try printing out your variable.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x

# or

print(x)

# see what happens when you do this

print("x")

```

This 'x' variable can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number. Try typing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
log(x)

# this is now the same as 
log(1/50)
```

The way R works is that first it looks for the commands on the right of the arrow. It runs all of them, calculates the result, then saves that result with the name on the left of the arrow. **It does not save the command itself, just the answer.** For example, in this case, R has no idea that `x` was created using maths, it just knows that it is equal to the number 0.02.

Notice also that variables can be reassigned. Type this into your console.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 100
print(x)
```

x used to contain the value 0.025 and and now it has the value 100.

*Note, the letter x isn't special in any way, it's just a variable name. You can replace it with any word you like as long as it contains no spaces and doesn't begin with a number*.

for example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vlogbrothers.DFTBA <- "Dont forget to be awesome"
print(vlogbrothers.DFTBA)
```

How you name stuff is up to you, , but be consistent. Different people use different conventions for long variable names, these include

-   periods.between.words.1 (as you can see, I like this)
-   underscores_between_words
-   camelCaseToSeparateWords

Finally, R IS CASE SENSITIVE. X and x are different variables! Try these and you will see both appear separately in your environment tab.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
h <- 1
H <- 2

ans <- h+H
print(ans)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(h)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(H)
```

To delete a variable, you can use the `rm()` command e.g.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(x)
```

and to clear everything, type

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
```

### Combining variables

As I showed above, you can now use multiple variables together in more complex commands. For example, try these commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 2

#Take the variable x, add 1 then save it to a new variable called y
y <- x + 1 

# print the multiple of 2yx onto the screen
print(2*y*x)
```

Now you can see that there are two variables in your environment tab, x and y. Where y is the sum of the contents of x plus 1.

You can even use this to change your original variable . Try typing the code below in a few times into the console and see what happens.

**A short cut to do this is to type the commands the first time, then use the up-arrow on your keyboard to cycle back through previous commands you have typed**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- x + 1 # notice how RStudio updates its description of x in the environment tab
x          # print the contents of "x" onto the screen
```

Our variables don't have to be numbers. They could refer to tables of data, or a spatial map, or any other complex thing. We will cover this more in future labs.

<br> <br>

<br> \## Variables and Commands (functions)

<br>

# Getting help {.tabset .tabset-fade}

First, take a look here to learn about help - <https://www.r-project.org/help.html>

When programming in R, someone often tells you about a "cool new command". I want you to feel comfortable working out how to use them. Equally, sometimes R crashes because it can't find a command. So this helps you find what you need to install.

## How to use the R help files {.unnumbered}

Here's how I approach it

1.  The only info we NEED to know about a new command is its name and the library/package/app it is stored in. <br>\

-   If you don't know, you can often google the command, and go to one of the websites with an online helpfile

-   Different websites have different ways of writing the things. For example, here are four common files you might see when looking at the mutate command which is a part of the dplyr package.

```{r, Tut13A, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "COMMAND=mutate, PACKAGE=dplyr",fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Tut_Fig13_mutateA.png')
```

```{r, Tut13B, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "COMMAND=mutate, PACKAGE=dplyr",fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Tut_Fig13_mutateB.png')
```

```{r, Tut13C, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "COMMAND=mutate, PACKAGE=dplyr",fig.align='center',out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Tut_Fig13_mutateD.png')
```

<p class="comment">

HINT FOR LAB 2, THE COMMAND ITSELF IS CALLED qtm...

</p>

<br>

2.  If you need to install the package, go to the Packages menu in the quadrant and click install.

<br>

3.  Add the `library(PACKAGENAME)` command to your library code chunk and run to load the package.

<br>

4.  Immediately go to the help file for the command you want to run. You can do this in the help menu next to the packages menu, or using a ? in the CONSOLE e.g. `?skim`. This will not work if you have not loaded the library.

<br>

5.  Inside every help file you will see this structure (SKIM THIS EXTERNAL: TUTORIAL)\[<https://bcgov.github.io/ds-cop-intro-to-r/seeking-help-in-r.html>\].

<br>

6.  FINALLY, **Scroll to the bottom of the helpfile** for some worked examples that you can literally copy and paste into your console or your code to understand how it works.

<p class="comment">

HINT FOR LAB 2, SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE HELP FILE

</p>

## EXAMPLE! Understanding `skim` {.unnumbered}

**I was told last year about a new summary command, skim. Here's how it ended up in your lab instructions**

1.  I googled 'skim r command'. This took me quickly to the R documentation page

```{r, Tut_Fig13, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Look for Rdocumentation, search-R-Project, or Rdrr",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Tut_Fig13a_HelpFile_skimrgoogle.png')
```

2.  I ended up at this website: <https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/skimr/html/skim.html>. From this I saw that the `skim()` command is in the `skimr` package\*

```{r, Tut_Fig13b, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "*The skim command is in the skimr package (red circle)*",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/Tut_Fig13_HelpFile_skimr.png')
```

3.  I added the `skimr` package to my library code chunk and re-ran

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# LIBRARIES
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

library(skimr) 
```

4.  In the console, I FIRST typed `> ?skimr` to read about the package itself (e.g. ?PACKAGENAME). This doesn't work if you didn't run the library code chunk first.

<br>

5.  In the console, I THEN typed `> ?skim` to bring up the help file and scrolled to the bottom. This doesn't work if you didn't run the library code chunk first. Inside every R help file you will see this structure: <https://bcgov.github.io/ds-cop-intro-to-r/seeking-help-in-r.html> but for now, I scrolled to the bottom.

<!-- -->

    <br>

6.  I then ran the help file worked examples in the console to understand the command. It looks like skim is a nice summary command I can apply to a table (in their case the iris table). And that's how it ended up here..

```{r}
 skim(iris)
 
 # Use tidyselect
 skim(iris, Species)
 skim(iris, starts_with("Sepal"))
 skim(iris, where(is.numeric))
```

<br>

7.  Finally, I googled tutorials to see if there was a friendlier way of looking: <https://docs.ropensci.org/skimr/reference/skim.html>

<br> <br>

# Scripts and Markdown

You might wonder at this point about how to save your work.

Typing into console is like having a phone call with your computer; you're talking but you're not keeping records of what you say. To see previous commands, you can click the history tab (Environment quadrant) or press the up/down arrows on your keyboard, but when you close R, all record of these commands will be lost.

We need instead is a way to save the commands for future use - we can do this using **scripts**.

There are several types of document, or script that you can create and save in R-Studio. There are about 20 options in the file menu. Here are a few important ones

## Types of script {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### A Basic R script (.r) \[IGNORE\] {.unnumbered}

<p class="comment">

WE WILL NORMALLY IGNORE THIS OPTION, but it's useful for a lot of programming and zero writing

</p>

-   This is simply just a blank notepad where you can save code commands. (How I learned to code)
-   You do NOT save any output

<br>

### R-Markdown {#Tut4a_WhatIsIt}

Typing console is a phone call to the computer, you're talking but you're not keeping records of what you say (you can always press the up key to see previous commands but that's about it). When you close R, everything you have done will be lost. As you might have seen, a basic R script is only one step better!

In this course we are going to focus on the R-Markdown format and you are going to submit your labs as websites/html files along with your code.

Markdown is cool.

Imagine a normal Microsoft Word document, but halfway through you can press a button and a mini R console appears. You type your code inside the mini console, it runs and puts the plots/output just below - then you leave the console and continue writing about the results. Essentially you never have to take another screenshot of results and move it to your output... Rmd files are also flexible. You can turn them into reports, websites, blogs, presentations or applications with a few short commands.

Read more here: <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or watch this short video

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
embed_url("https://vimeo.com/178485416?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=22717988")
```

<br> <br>

# Markdown Basics {#Tut4C_Basics}

Your file contains some friendly text to explain what is going on, which I have annotated here. Read the file and see what it says.

```{r, tut4fig3, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut4_markdown_fig3.png')
```

## Creating a markdown document

Save your R-script to your Lab 1 folder and close it.

Time to make your own. Go to the File menu on the top left, then click New File - **R-Markdown**. If this is your first time ever, it might ask to download some packages to be able to do this. Say yes.

Eventually a window will open up:

```{r, tut4fig1b, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut4_markdown_fig1.png')
```

It will ask you to name and save your file. Give it a relevant name. A new file should appear on your screen. At the top of that window (by the knit button, there is a "knit button". Click that and it should make a website and autosave it for you. Make sure your email ID is somewhere in there.

```{r, tut4fig2c, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Yours will say GEOG-364 not GEOG-364.."}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut4_markdown_fig2.png')
```

The new file on your screen is your first markdown script. Essentially, we have some space for text, some space for code, and a space at the top of the file where we can add information about themes/styles etc.

<br>

<br>

## Knitting {#Tut4Da_knit}

The file on your screen isn't the finished article. To see how it will look as a final version, we need to "knit" it. Go to the top of the .Rmd file, find the `knit` button. Press it (you might have to first save your script if you haven't already, then press it again)

You should see that the Markdown tab "builds" your document and you get an output as a website. The html should also be saved into your project folder. For example, from my other class, here is a file with markdown and knitted output.

```{r, tut4fig4, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/pg_Tut4_markdown_fig4.png')
```

<br> <br>
